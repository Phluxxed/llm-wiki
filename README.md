# llm-wiki

A skill that scaffolds a persistent, LLM-maintained wiki — inspired by Karpathy's personal wiki pattern.

Drop it into your agent's skills directory, then run `/wikime` in any project to get a fully operational wiki scaffold in seconds.

## What it sets up

```
your-wiki/
├── wiki-agent.md          ← agent operating manual (all instructions live here)
├── CLAUDE.md              ← @wiki-agent.md (or natural-language pointer for other agents)
├── CONVENTIONS.md         ← human-readable naming and structure reference
├── README.md              ← quick start and scripts reference
├── index.md               ← one-liner catalog of all wiki pages
├── log.md                 ← append-only change history
├── {page-type}/           ← primary wiki pages (e.g. papers/, use-cases/, experiments/)
│   └── *.md
├── entities/              ← entity and concept pages
│   └── *.md
├── _templates/
│   ├── {page-type}.md     ← template for new pages
│   └── entity.md          ← template for entity/concept pages
├── sources/               ← immutable raw inputs (never edited after saving)
└── scripts/
    ├── graph.py           ← generates graph.html — D3.js force-directed graph of all pages
    ├── lint.py            ← structural health check
    └── query.py           ← frontmatter queries (filter by status, category, tag, etc.)
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Phluxxed/llm-wiki ~/llm-wiki

# Symlink into your agent's skills directory (recommended — keeps it version-controlled)
# Claude Code example:
ln -s ~/llm-wiki ~/.claude/skills/wikime
```

Each agent has its own skills directory — your agent will know where to look.

Requires `pyyaml` for the scripts:

```bash
pip3 install pyyaml
```

## Usage

In any directory (empty or existing project), run:

```
/wikime
```

The skill asks two questions — what the wiki is for, and what the primary page type is — then scaffolds everything in one pass.

**Supported page types:** use cases, papers, experiments, runbooks, ADRs, or anything else you name.

**Safe on existing projects:** if a `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `GEMINI.md` already exists, the skill appends a single pointer line rather than overwriting it. If `wiki-agent.md` already exists, the skill stops — you already have a wiki.

## Scripts

| Script | Command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/lint.py` | `python3 scripts/lint.py` | Structural health check — missing sections, broken refs, open risks, index consistency |
| `scripts/query.py` | `python3 scripts/query.py --help` | Frontmatter queries — filter by `--status`, `--category`, `--type`, `--tag`, `--stale`, `--risks` |
| `scripts/graph.py` | `python3 scripts/graph.py` | Generates `graph.html` — open in browser for an interactive graph of all pages and relationships |

## Agent compatibility

Works with any agent that supports skills. The running agent creates its own schema file — a one-line pointer to `wiki-agent.md` where all instructions live.

| Agent | Schema file | Pointer format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `@wiki-agent.md` (native include) |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | Natural-language pointer |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Natural-language pointer |
